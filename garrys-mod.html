                <p class="fs-5">Garry's mod is one of the games that I cherish from my childhood, and has become one of my favorite testing area for my programming abilities. This is because you could go online and show others what cool mechanisms you've made, often being complimented in the process. I did this with an addon called E2 (Expression 2) which has code editor with its own weird syntax, the syntax is supposed to resemble lua, but it feels like a mix of lua and javascript with less features. So not ideal of course, but limitations are fun to play around.</p>
                <p class="fs-5 detailed-view blue d-none">You could for example not create objects in a nice organized way. You could use a Table data structure, but these were confusing to work with since you did not have an organized structure like you have with a class from which you can glance the variables/functions. In fact, you can not put functions inside of the table, these had to be separate. So I in most cases refrained from using them since they took more effort than writing arrays for values.</p>

                <p id="holograms" class="fs-3 text-primary">Holograms</p>

                <p class="fs-5">My first few projects were based around making simple holograms, holograms are 3d models that can be created and adjusted by code. With the 3 basic properties (position, scale and rotation) you can already make all kinds of visualisations. You could create a house with holograms, a ship, or even moving holograms that resembles a creature. Combining math and holograms allowed me to create a solar system, or a creature that follows the player character, attacks others, or gives access to a new way of movement within the game.</p>
                <p class="fs-5 detailed-view blue d-none">I was and still am fascinated by space and orbital mechanics, no matter how complex they are. In my first project I decided to make a solar system with simple periodic motion. My star was always at the center, never moving, and my planet was orbiting the star with sine cosine and an incrementing angle to make it move in a perfect circle around the star. </p>

                <p id="holograms" class="fs-3 text-primary">The music player project</p>

                <p class="fs-5">And one of my proudest projects in garry's mod is my music player project, this script can load custom files and play music based on the contents inside of the file. The custom content is generated by a script in visual studio, which turns midi's into my own text data format, the format looks like this</p>

                <p id="holograms" class="fs-3 text-primary">Limitations</p>

                <p class="fs-5">An unfortunate limitation inside of Expression 2 is OPS, which stands for Operations Per Second. Every operation you do, creating a hologram, moving a hologram, doing complex math generates OPS. Once a chip reaches a certain threshold the chip disables itself, which deletes all holograms and prevents any code from running. However, this does enable programmers to write efficient code, sadly it does not allow for 5000 asteroids to orbit around a single star. And thats not only because of OPS, but also the limitation of holograms you can make and the limitations of the source engine in rendering. </p>
