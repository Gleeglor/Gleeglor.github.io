                <p class="fs-5">A dark and unforgiving world, yet amidst the tragedy this game has sparked a sense of beauty in the decaying world of rainworld. This game has in a way become a part of me, and it feels really special to me. From the start of the game till the end, you fight against the ecosystem, and eventually you start to learn how the world works and what role you play. After this realisation you start to become part of the ecosystem instead of fighting against it. And because of this you discover a new appreciation for the areas and creatures in rainworld. The game is definitely not for everyone, it is hard and unforgiving for newcomers. It will never back down and you will suffer for a long time before it starts to feel comfortable. But its special to me and many others.</p>

                <p class="fs-5">The game was so special for me that I wanted to see what was hidden, not in the world but in the code. I started digging through the code with an application called "dnspy" and learned how the creator of Rainworld, joar jakobsson, designed his classes and methods. The game is made in C# and I've had some experience with it before, but this solidified my knowledge further. I started playing around with object properties, for example a rock, what happens when it hits something? What can I adjust? What happens if I increase the force the rock applies on creatures? With this playing around came the idea, what if I make it explode, and how big can I make the explosion?</p>

                <p id="holograms" class="fs-3 text-primary">The singularity grenade</p>
                <p class="fs-5">Playing around was fun, after creating an explosion that wipes out every creature on the screen I decided to call it the singularity bomb. But it can't just be throw and boom, it has to have a cool animation and effects. So I ended up with the idea of:</p>
                <ul class="ps-5 fs-5">
                    <li>Throw bomb.</li>
                    <li>Bomb lands.</li>
                    <li>Bomb flies up a little.</li>
                    <li>Bomb generates cool effects that get increasingly bigger.</li>
                    <li>Bomb explodes.</li>
                    <li>Bomb leaves behind an effect that lasts for a bit.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="fs-5">More information soon...</p>
